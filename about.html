        <h2>About</h2> 
             <p>Elysian Vow is a writing and worldbuilding project covering a variety of fantasy topics. This website is dedicated to in-world lore regarding this project, including Codex Entries, and Short Stories. This page is dedicated to information about the project, the writing, the design, and the resources used. As well as myself.</p>
                <h3>Codex</h3>
                    <p>Codex entires are pages dedicated to specific things within the world, such as characters or locations, displayed in more of a Wiki-style format, making them easy to read. The Codex will likely make up a bulk of the content within this site overall, whether they will cover everything im not sure currently. The plan is to update them periodically and in groups as and when I have the material to do so.</p>
                <h3>Stories</h3>
                    <p>Short stories may be few and far between, but as the world develops more, I may take some time to write some up and integrate them into the lore a bit more. I would like to have a range of them later. However, it will depend on how my process continues and whether I can fit them in with everything else.</p>
                <h3>Authors</h3>
                    <p>All lore writings on the site will be in-world, meaning the information is written from the perspective of a character. This means that the information may or may not be completely accurate to the real lore. The aim is to have a variety of perspectives within the writing. Some will clearly show their bias, some will try to convey more truthful sentiments. Its up to you as the reader to decide whos account can be trusted.</p>
                <h3>Website</h3>
                    <p>This website is currently only written in HTML/CSS with a tiny bit of JavaScript. Later on, I may move over to a PhP-based site hooked up to a database, but ultimately, this was good enough for static webpages, as this site in its current state is mostly just for viewing and a place for me to compile official writings in an easy-to-view format. In the future, I may migrate to a more complex site hosted outside of GitHub. </p>
                <h3>Resources</h3>
                    <p>Varied tools have been used within the project. The website originally started development on Eclipse Che. later simply moved to Brackets. GIMP has been used for varied visual pieces such as maps or other illustrations. Essentially all editing. Canvas of Kings, as well as Mapgen2 (Polygon map generator) are used for various maps or top down land formations. Fantasy name generator used frequently for inspiration, Pixel applications such as Aesprite. Reroll and Game Character Hub were also used, as well as good old pen and paper. I'm most likely missing some, but I will try to keep this section up to date.</p>
                <h3>Inspirations</h3>
                    <p>The writing takes a lot of direct inspiration from a wide range of fantasy media. Dragon Age is likely the biggest influence behind a lot of ideas and concepts, including the idea of implementing a Codex on this website. However, I have also taken a lot of inspiration from Tolkein's writings, (lotr especially) The Soulsborne games, Pillars of Eternity, and a few others. I'm a big nerd for Dark Fantasy and decided to take this project in a direction where it encompasses Medieval/Renaissance fantasy in a darker setting.</p>
                <h3>Future</h3>
                    <p>Future plans aren't very concrete. I will likely update this site passively and more than likely have large gaps between new material being added. However, it will never be abandoned.</p>
                <h3>Other</h3>
                    <p>I have some other creative projects, mainly involving music, which is my main hobby. Links to any of these that are published are within the footer. Feel free to check them out if you're interested. I may compose some recordings for this project later on also.</p>
